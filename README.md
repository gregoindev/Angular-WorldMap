# Angular-WorldMap

Hi and welcome to my Angular school project! This was my very first time using the Angular framework. I think I like Angular better than React! ðŸ˜œ

This project was about transforming an SVG map into an interactive one by introducing mouse events. This app is also connected to an API service called WorldBank API.

--=This project was generated with Angular CLI version 17.0.0.
