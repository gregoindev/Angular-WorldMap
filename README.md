# Angular-WorldMap

Hi and welcome to my Angular project! This was my very first time using the Angular framework. 

This project was about transforming an SVG map into an interactive one by introducing mouse events. This app is also connected to an API service called WorldBank API.

--=This project was generated with Angular CLI version 17.0.0.
